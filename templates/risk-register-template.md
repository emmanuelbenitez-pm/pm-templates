## 🎯 What is a Risk Register?

A Risk Register is a project management tool that identifies, assesses, and tracks risks throughout the project lifecycle. It enables proactive risk management rather than reactive problem-solving.

### Key Concepts

**Risk vs Issue:**
- **Risk** = Something that MIGHT happen (future, uncertain)
- **Issue** = Something that HAS happened (present, certain)

**Risk Components:**
- **Probability** = Likelihood of occurrence (High/Medium/Low)
- **Impact** = Consequence if it occurs (High/Medium/Low)
- **Risk Score** = Probability × Impact (guides prioritization)

## 📊 Risk Matrix

### Probability × Impact Grid

|  | **HIGH Impact** | **MEDIUM Impact** | **LOW Impact** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HIGH Probability** | 🔴 CRITICAL (9) | 🔴 HIGH (6) | 🟡 MEDIUM (3) |
| **MEDIUM Probability** | 🔴 HIGH (6) | 🟡 MEDIUM (4) | 🟢 LOW (2) |
| **LOW Probability** | 🟡 MEDIUM (3) | 🟢 LOW (2) | 🟢 LOW (1) |

### Risk Level Definitions

| Level | Score | Response Required |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| 🔴 **CRITICAL** | 9 | Immediate action, executive escalation |
| 🔴 **HIGH** | 6 | Mitigation plan within 48 hours |
| 🟡 **MEDIUM** | 3-4 | Monitor closely, mitigation plan within 1 week |
| 🟢 **LOW** | 1-2 | Accept or monitor, periodic review |

## 🎯 Risk Response Strategies

### For Negative Risks (Threats)

#### 1. **AVOID** - Eliminate the risk
- Change project plan to eliminate risk
- Remove risky feature or requirement
- Choose different technology or approach

**Example:** Switch from unproven new technology to mature, stable alternative

#### 2. **MITIGATE** - Reduce probability or impact
- Add testing or quality checks
- Increase resources or buffer time
- Implement redundancy or backup systems

**Example:** Hire consultant expert to reduce probability of technical failure

#### 3. **TRANSFER** - Shift risk to third party
- Outsource risky component
- Purchase insurance
- Use fixed-price contracts

**Example:** Use vendor's hosted solution instead of building in-house

#### 4. **ACCEPT** - Acknowledge and monitor
- Active acceptance: Create contingency plan
- Passive acceptance: Deal with it if it happens

**Example:** Accept risk of minor UI changes during development

### For Positive Risks (Opportunities)

#### 1. **EXPLOIT** - Ensure opportunity happens
- Assign best resources
- Fast-track schedule

#### 2. **ENHANCE** - Increase probability or benefits
- Add resources to accelerate
- Expand scope of opportunity

#### 3. **SHARE** - Allocate ownership to third party
- Partnership or joint venture
- Shared risk/reward

#### 4. **ACCEPT** - Take advantage if it happens
- Don't actively pursue but be ready

## 💡 Best Practices

### Creating Your Risk Register

1. **Start early** - Identify risks during project planning
2. **Involve the team** - Brainstorm risks with full team
3. **Be specific** - "Database might not scale" not "Technical issues"
4. **Quantify impact** - "$100K cost overrun" not "Expensive"
5. **Assign owners** - Every risk needs someone watching it
6. **Review regularly** - Weekly for active projects

### Identifying Risks

**Techniques:**
- Brainstorming sessions with team
- Review lessons learned from past projects
- Interview subject matter experts
- SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
- Assumptions analysis (what if assumption is wrong?)
- Dependency analysis (what if dependency fails?)

**Good Questions to Ask:**
- "What could go wrong?"
- "What are we assuming?"
- "What don't we know?"
- "What has gone wrong on similar projects?"
- "What keeps you up at night about this project?"

### Writing Risk Descriptions

**Poor:**
- ❌ "There might be problems"
- ❌ "Integration could be hard"
- ❌ "We might be late"

**Good:**
- ✅ "If vendor API changes without notice, our integration will break, requiring 2-3 weeks rework"
- ✅ "If key developer leaves, project could be delayed 4-6 weeks due to knowledge transfer"
- ✅ "If cloud costs exceed estimates by 50%, we'll need additional $200K budget approval"

### Monitoring Risks

**Red Flags:**
- Trigger events are occurring
- Probability or impact is increasing
- Mitigation actions not working
- New information changes assessment
- Team is avoiding discussing the risk

**Green Flags:**
- Mitigation actions proving effective
- Probability or impact decreasing
- More information reduces uncertainty
- Alternative solutions identified

## 🔄 Risk Review Process

### Weekly Risk Review (30 min)

**Agenda:**
1. **Review critical/high risks** (5 min each)
   - Status update
   - Trigger events observed?
   - Mitigation actions effectiveness
   - Update probability/impact if changed

2. **Quick scan of medium risks** (10 min)
   - Any changes?
   - Any escalating?

3. **Identify new risks** (10 min)
   - What emerged this week?
   - Any assumptions proven wrong?

4. **Action items** (5 min)
   - Assign new action items
   - Confirm deadlines

### Monthly Deep Dive (2 hours)

1. Review all risks thoroughly
2. Reassess probability and impact
3. Review effectiveness of mitigation strategies
4. Close risks that are no longer relevant
5. Update risk trends and metrics
6. Present to steering committee

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Poor Risk Management

1. **Confusing risks with issues**
   - Wrong: "Database is down" (that's an issue)
   - Right: "Database might fail under peak load"

2. **Too vague**
   - Wrong: "Vendor risk"
   - Right: "Vendor may not deliver API by milestone 3, causing 6-week delay"

3. **No ownership**
   - Every risk needs an owner monitoring it

4. **Set and forget**
   - Risk register must be reviewed regularly

5. **All risks are high**
   - If everything is critical, nothing is critical

6. **No mitigation plans**
   - Identifying without action is useless

7. **Ignoring positive risks**
   - Opportunities should also be tracked
