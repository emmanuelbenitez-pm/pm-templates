## 💡 How to Use This Template

### Frequency Options
- **Weekly:** Standard for most projects (recommended)
- **Bi-weekly:** For slower-moving or smaller projects
- **Daily:** Crisis mode or go-live periods

### Customization Tips
1. **For Executives:** Keep to 1-2 pages, focus on Executive Summary & Decisions Needed
2. **For Team:** Include more detail in Progress Metrics & Activities
3. **For Agile Projects:** Emphasize sprint metrics, burndown, velocity
4. **For Waterfall:** Emphasize phase completion, milestone dates, gate criteria

### Best Practices
- ✅ **Be concise** - use bullet points, not paragraphs
- ✅ **Be visual** - use colors, emojis, progress bars
- ✅ **Be honest** - don't hide problems, propose solutions
- ✅ **Be consistent** - same format, same day, same time
- ✅ **Be actionable** - every red item has an action plan
- ✅ **Update metrics** - don't copy/paste from last week

### Red Flags to Avoid
- ❌ No clear status (green/yellow/red)
- ❌ Burying critical issues in middle of document
- ❌ Vague language ("making progress", "almost done")
- ❌ No actions for problems identified
- ❌ Inconsistent format week-to-week
- ❌ Too long (>3 pages for executives)
