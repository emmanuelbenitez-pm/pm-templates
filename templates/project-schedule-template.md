## 🛤️ Critical Path

### Critical Path Tasks

The critical path represents the longest sequence of dependent tasks that determines the minimum project duration. Any delay in critical path tasks delays the entire project.

**Critical Path Sequence:**
```
1.2 Project Charter → 2.1 WBS → 2.2 Schedule → 3.2 Requirements → 
4.1 Architecture → 4.4 Design Review → 5.2 Backend Dev → 5.4 Integration → 
6.3 Integration Test → 6.5 UAT → 7.2 Deployment → 7.4 Go-Live
```

**Critical Path Duration:** [X weeks]  
**Project Float/Slack:** [X days] (buffer available)

**Critical Path Tasks:**
| Task ID | Task Name | Duration | Slack | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| 1.2 | Project Charter | 5 days | 0 days | ✅ Complete |
| 3.2 | Requirements Documentation | 10 days | 0 days | ✅ Complete |
| 4.1 | Architecture Design | 10 days | 0 days | 🟡 In Progress |
| 5.2 | Backend Development | 30 days | 0 days | 🟡 In Progress |
| 6.5 | UAT | 10 days | 0 days | ⚪ Not Started |
| 7.4 | Go-Live | 1 day | 0 days | ⚪ Not Started |

**⚠️ Risk:** Any delay in critical path tasks directly impacts project completion date.

## 📊 Schedule Performance

### Earned Value Metrics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Planned Value (PV)** | $250,000 | Baseline |
| **Earned Value (EV)** | $240,000 | Work completed |
| **Actual Cost (AC)** | $245,000 | Spent to date |
| **Schedule Variance (SV)** | -$10,000 | 🟡 Slightly behind |
| **Cost Variance (CV)** | -$5,000 | 🟡 Slightly over |
| **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)** | 0.96 | 🟡 Below 1.0 |
| **Cost Performance Index (CPI)** | 0.98 | 🟡 Below 1.0 |

**Interpretation:**
- SPI < 1.0: Project is behind schedule
- CPI < 1.0: Project is over budget
- Current trend: Need to accelerate or reduce scope

---

### Schedule Baseline vs Actual
```
Planned Progress:   ████████████████░░░░ 80%
Actual Progress:    ███████████████░░░░░ 75%
Variance:           -5% (behind schedule)
```

**Trend Analysis:**
- Week 1-4: Ahead of schedule (+5%)
- Week 5-8: On schedule (0%)
- Week 9-12: Behind schedule (-3%)
- Week 13-16: Behind schedule (-5%) ← Current

**Root Causes:**
- Design review taking longer than expected
- Backend development complexity underestimated
- Two team members on PTO in Week 14

## ⚠️ Schedule Risks

### Risks to Schedule

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact (Days) | Mitigation | Owner |
|---------|------------------|-------------|---------------|------------|-------|
| SR-001 | Backend dev delay | High | +10 days | Add developer, reduce scope | [Tech Lead] |
| SR-002 | UAT availability | Medium | +5 days | Schedule UAT early, backup testers | [PM] |
| SR-003 | Third-party API delay | Low | +15 days | Start integration early, have plan B | [Architect] |
| SR-004 | Holiday season slowdown | Medium | +7 days | Front-load work, minimize Dec work | [PM] |

**Total Schedule Risk Exposure:** +37 days (worst case)  
**Contingency Buffer:** 15 days  
**Risk:** Schedule buffer insufficient for all risks

## 💡 Schedule Management Best Practices

### Do's ✅

1. **Update Weekly** - Review and update schedule every week
2. **Track Critical Path** - Monitor critical tasks closely
3. **Manage Float** - Use slack time strategically
4. **Communicate Changes** - Notify stakeholders of delays immediately
5. **Document Assumptions** - Record all schedule assumptions
6. **Build in Buffers** - Add contingency for high-risk tasks
7. **Review Dependencies** - Check dependencies weekly
8. **Baseline Schedule** - Freeze baseline after approval

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Don't Skip Updates** - Stale schedules are useless
2. **Don't Hide Delays** - Transparency builds trust
3. **Don't Over-Optimize** - Good enough is better than perfect
4. **Don't Ignore Float** - Use available slack
5. **Don't Fast-Track Recklessly** - Consider risks
6. **Don't Forget Resources** - Schedule needs people
7. **Don't Skip Dependencies** - Leads to rework
8. **Don't Change Baseline** - Only change with approval

## 🎓 Schedule Compression Techniques

### When Behind Schedule

#### Fast Tracking
**What:** Overlap tasks normally done in sequence  
**Example:** Start coding while design is being reviewed  
**Risk:** Rework if design changes  
**When to use:** Low-risk overlaps, late in project

#### Crashing
**What:** Add resources to shorten duration  
**Example:** Add another developer to backend work  
**Risk:** Higher cost, learning curve  
**When to use:** Critical path tasks, budget available

#### Scope Reduction
**What:** Remove non-critical features  
**Example:** Defer mobile app to Phase 2  
**Risk:** Stakeholder disappointment  
**When to use:** Severe delays, budget constraints
