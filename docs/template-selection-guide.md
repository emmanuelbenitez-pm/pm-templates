## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Minimal** - Begin with 3-5 templates, add more only if needed
2. **Combine Templates** - Use RAID Log instead of 4 separate logs
3. **Tailor to Audience** - Executive stakeholders need Status Dashboard, not detailed logs
4. **Iterate** - Adjust template selection based on what works
5. **Ask Your Team** - Which templates add value? Which are bureaucracy?
